scgen-taper (written in MATLAB 2016b) is a free set of codes used to design dispersion-engineered photonic crystal fibers to produce flat, broadband supercontinua for astronomical applications, as described in [arXiv:1807.07857](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07857). It features a graphical user interface which allows the user to visualize fiber geometry, pulse evolution, and probe the spectra at arbitrary cuts along the fiber length. The codes are readily adapted to other applications involving longitudinally varying fiber geometries.
